            <h1>Emil Hernvall</h1>

            <p>
            I'm a Swedish guy in my mid twenties. I currently work as architect and CTO for a company 
            called <a href="http://znaptag.com/">Znaptag</a>. This page is a collection of various 
            experiments I've done throughout the years. Most of what you'll find here is weekend 
            projects, but a few are a bit more extensive.
            </p>

            Although not as much nowadays, I used to be an active member at Stack Overflow. You can
            check out my profile below.

            <h2>Projects</h2>

            <p>
            This is a rather incomplete list of things I've done throughout the years. It's not
            really representative of the work I normally do, but I think it does convey a good
            picture about my interests.
            </p>

            <h3>UglyLang</h3>

            <p>
            Toy programming language. It's currently implemented in Java, but I dream of bootstrapping
            it eventually. Current all execution is interpreted. The language as such is characterized
            by its static type system, which guarantees type safety. It's a cross between the functional
            and imperative paradigms.

            <h3>Tregmine</h3>

            <p>
            Plugin for the bukkit minecraft server, that provides most of the features needed

            for the <a href="http://tregmine.info">Tregmine</a> minecraft server.

            A visualizer framework for spotify, using the official libspotify. Includes some
            simple FFT-based visualizers, that works somewhat well. Should be easily extendable.
            Uses the windows DirectDraw API.

            <p>
            A java implementation of an irc server. Currently no support for linking
            other servers, and also no services. Both will hopefully be fixed eventually.

            problems (probably less than five) have partial solutions that doesn't give the
            correct answer.
