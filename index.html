		<h1>Emil Hernvall</h1>
		
		<p>
			I'm a Swedish guy in my mid twenties. For the past few years I've worked as a programmer 
			and architect for a company called <a href="http://quench.at/">Quench</a>. We develop
			price comparison technology, which can be licensed as a web service. I have no formal
			education in programming. Rather I've studied chemistry and engineering physics
			at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and at Uppsala University. Despite
			that I've always considered myself primarily a programmer, and I've made an effort
			to pick up what I would have learned had I attended a computer science education.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I spent several years as a PHP developer before seeing the light. Now I avoid PHP
			when I can and prefer Python, Java or C/C++ instead. Lately I've been trying to learn
			Haskell as well.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Although not as much nowadays, I used to be an active member at Stack Overflow. You can
			check out my profile below.

		<h2>Projects</h2>
		
		<p>
			I've uploaded a few of my experiments from the last few years to github. Smaller
			things are available as <a href="http://gist.github.com/EmilHernvall">gists</a>.
			Somewhat larger projects are uploaded as regular repositories and can be accessed
			from my <a href="http://github.com/EmilHernvall">Github profile</a>.

		<p>
			A visualizer framework for spotify, using the official libspotify. Includes some
			simple FFT-based visualizers, that works somewhat well. Should be easily extendable.
			Uses the windows DirectDraw API.

            An implementation of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">Quad Tree</a>,
            originally written for use in a Minecraft Server. Optimized for efficiently looking
            up which of a set of rectangles that a point in 2d space belongs to. Only supports
            a sub set of operations right now.
