		<h1>Emil Hernvall</h1>
		
		<p>
			I'm a Swedish guy in my mid twenties. For the past few years I've worked as a programmer 
			and architect for a company called <a href="http://quench.at/">Quench</a>. We develop
			price comparison technology, which can be licensed as a web service. I have no formal
			education in programming. Rather I've studied chemistry and engineering physics
			at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and at Uppsala University. Despite
			that I've always considered myself primarily a programmer, and I've made an effort
			to pick up what I would have learned had I attended a computer science education.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I spent several years as a PHP developer before seeing the light. Now I avoid PHP
			when I can and prefer Python, Java or C/C++ instead. Lately I've been trying to learn
			Haskell as well.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Although not as much nowadays, I used to be an active member at Stack Overflow. You can
			check out my profile below.

		<h2>Projects</h2>
		
		<p>
			This is a rather incomplete list of things I've done throughout the years. It's not
            really representative of the work I normally do, but I think it does convey a good
            picture about my interests.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Candify</h3>
		
		<a href="http://github.com/EmilHernvall/candify/raw/master/candify.png"><img src="img/candify.jpg" /></a>
		
		<p>
			A visualizer framework for spotify, using the official libspotify. Includes some
			simple FFT-based visualizers, that works somewhat well. Should be easily extendable.
			Uses the windows DirectDraw API. 
			<a href="https://github.com/EmilHernvall/candify">Code is here.</a>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Cropper</h3>
		
		<a href="http://github.com/EmilHernvall/cropper/raw/master/cropper.png"><img src="img/cropper.jpg" /></a>
		
		<p>
			Simple program to crop images quickly. Written using WinApi and GDI+.
			<a href="http://github.com/EmilHernvall/cropper">Code is here</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Collapsible</h3>
		
		<a href="http://github.com/EmilHernvall/collapsible/raw/master/collapsible.jpg"><img src="img/collapsible.jpg" /></a>
		
		<p>
			Horrendously ugly tetris clone. WinApi and DirectDraw.
			<a href="https://github.com/EmilHernvall/collapsible">Code is here.</a>
		</p>
		
		<h3>FatCat</h3>
		
		<p>
			A java implementation of an irc server. Currently no support for linking
			other servers, and also no services. Both will hopefully be fixed eventually.
			<a href="https://github.com/EmilHernvall/fatcat">Code is here.</a>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Project Euler Solutions</h3>
		
		<p>
			Solutions for the hundred first <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>
			or so. <a href="https://github.com/EmilHernvall/projecteuler">Code is here.</a>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Mosaic</h3>

			<img src="http://blog.c0la.se/examples/mosaic/samples/raven.jpg" height="300" />
		</a>-->
		
		<p>
			A small unix program that constructs an image mosaic from a source image
			and a collection of smaller images (mosaic bricks).
			<a href="https://github.com/EmilHernvall/mosaic">Code is here.</a>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Calculator</h3>
		
		<p>
			A java program that evaluates arbitrary mathematical expressions.
			Also includes some primitive plotting capabilities.

        <h3>3D Engine</h3>
        
        <a href="img/3dengine.jpg"><img src="img/3dengine-small.jpg" /></a>
        
        <p>
            Experiment with software rasterization. Written mostly as a learning project,
            and horrendously unoptimized. 
            <a href="https://github.com/EmilHernvall/3DEngine">Code is here.</a>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Quad Tree</h3>
        
        <p>
            An implementation of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">Quad Tree</a>,
            originally written for use in a Minecraft Server. Optimized for efficiently looking
            up which of a set of rectangles that a point in 2d space belongs to. Only supports
            a sub set of operations right now.
